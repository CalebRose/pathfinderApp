# project1 Master Branch

## Product: Pathfinder App

### Purpose:
Allow users to compare routes from various services. Namely...
 - Google
 - TomTom
 - Leaflet
 
 Users can compare the distances and routes provided to them by these services. Users should be able to see how long it takes to travel on received routes.

### Nice to Haves:
 - Allow users to input the time actually traveled on a given route
 - Compile and calculate user inputs into an average time for the given route
 - Compare user input, average user input, and API route time
 - Include Apple API for further comparison
 - I suppose we can include Bing too
